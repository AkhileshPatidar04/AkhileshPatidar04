# Hi, I'm Akhilesh Patidar

I am a Computer Science student with a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms**. I enjoy solving problems with logical thinking and often approach them from different, optimized perspectives.

I focus on understanding the core idea of a concept — once I get it, I can implement and apply it to any problem without needing repeated practice or memorization.

## 📈 My DSA Journey

I started my journey in Data Structures and Algorithms by approaching problems randomly — without following any fixed pattern or solution guide. I would try to solve problems based purely on logic and intuition. While this made things challenging at first, it played a major role in developing my thinking ability and helped me understand how to approach unknown problems.

As I gradually started solving more problems, I began analyzing standard approaches and solutions. This helped me identify common patterns and categorize problems based on their type — such as recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, or graph-based problems. It also taught me how to choose the right technique for a given problem based on constraints and structure.

Now, I follow a hybrid approach:
- First, I attempt the problem with my own logic.
- Then, I reflect on standard methods to fill any gaps in understanding.
- This way, I build both intuition and theoretical clarity.

This journey has made me a better and faster problem solver, and it continues to shape how I learn and grow in computer science.
