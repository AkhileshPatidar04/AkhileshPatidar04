## üìà My DSA Journey

I started my journey in Data Structures and Algorithms by approaching problems randomly ‚Äî without following any fixed pattern or solution guide. I would try to solve problems based purely on logic and intuition. While this made things challenging at first, it played a major role in developing my thinking ability and helped me understand how to approach unknown problems.

As I gradually started solving more problems, I began analyzing standard approaches and solutions. This helped me identify common patterns and categorize problems based on their type ‚Äî such as recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, or graph-based problems. It also taught me how to choose the right technique for a given problem based on constraints and structure.

Now, I follow a hybrid approach:
- First, I attempt the problem with my own logic.
- Then, I reflect on standard methods to fill any gaps in understanding.
- This way, I build both intuition and theoretical clarity.

This journey has made me a better and faster problem solver, and it continues to shape how I learn and grow in computer science.
